# Car-Rental

## Project overview
A car rental project that runs on the console and interacts with the user.
It it consisted of a user mode (rent a cart, cancel a rent...) and an admin mode
(add cart to the list, cancel a rent...). The program starts by saving every thing found in 
the csv files into some arrays, and all the updates will be saved in the pdf after exiting.

## Future goals
- Fix some bugs
